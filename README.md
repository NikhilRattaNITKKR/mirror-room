# Mirror Room Project by Naxxatra

### Project Description

To be filled...

### Problem statement

> This is a code to display the motion of a monochromatic light ray, laser, when it travels through a
> non-refracting medium and gets reflected by a reflecting material, such as a mirror, placed at a
> certain angle at a distance from the source. And the aim is to trace the path the light ray travels
> 
> when there are n number of mirrors at a certain angle while the user inputs the angle of incident of
> the source to the first mirror.
> 
> This experiment/code is useful in representation of the way light ray travels through telescope, of
> any wave length before it reaches the eyepiece or the receiver, and its also a fun user experience
> where one can use the laws of physics to play with the amazing phenomena of “reflection”
